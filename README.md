# Hack #2
The repository contains the problem statement for Hack #2 provided by Cisco.

## Problem Statement

Create a tool/app to do a "smart" security scan of a network router/access point that a user's device is attached to.

## Background:

Most home users seem to have almost no idea about how secure their home networks are, who might be trying to hack them, etc.  Many users don't really understand how vulnerable their home networks might be.

The app could do a few things. The first would be to learn how to connect to some standard home networking devices and download log files, scan them for possible problems. It could also check for common problems like missing or default passwords, etc.  Ideally it would run in the background and run periodically when connected to a known/home network, scan for issues, and display alert notifications if a problem is found.  It should be possible to get some basic functionality in place and have ability to add more as time permits or later even outside the hackathon. 

## Scoring Rubric:

### Innovativeness:

- Idea/solution is an incremental improvement in the way we do things today and will keep our current offerings strong but will not generate new opportunities
- Idea/solution is a substantial new opportunity in the way we do things today and will make our current offerings competitive in the market
- Idea/solution will create a new market/offering for Cisco and will generate a new source of revenue

### Value Proposition:

- Idea/solution has no potential to generate new revenue or productivity improvements
- Idea/solution has a greater than 50 percent chance
- Idea/solution has a greater than 75 percent chance to generate new revenue or productivity improvements

### Prototype:
- Solution does not feature a prototype
- Solution does feature a working prototype

### Longevity:
- Solution is not likely to be further developed after this weekend
- Solution has a greater than 50 percent chance to be included into an existing product or capability roadmap
- Solution has a greater than 75 percent chance to be included into an existing product of capability roadmap

### Quality:

- Solution is hastily put together proof of concept with no consideration for design or architecture
- Solution is elegantly designed and architected
